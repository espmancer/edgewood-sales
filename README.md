# Concept
Edgewood University has once again hired you to create a program for them: A sales manager for their musical instrument purchases. The program will need to access and modify a database, allow users to access a UI in order to purchase instruments, and allow administrators to access a UI to modify the item count and items within the menu.
# Purpose
I haven't worked in C++ in a while so I'm brushing up on it with a basic project.
